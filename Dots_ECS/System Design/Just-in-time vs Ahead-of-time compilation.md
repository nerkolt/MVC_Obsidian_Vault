# Just-in-time
* (**JIT**) **compilation** (also **dynamic translation** or **run-time compilations**) is [compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") during execution of a program (at [run time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_\(program_lifecycle_phase\) "Run time (program lifecycle phase)")) rather than before execution.
* This may consist of [source code translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_translation "Source code translation") but is more commonly [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode "Bytecode") translation to [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code "Machine code"), which is then executed directly.
* IT compilation is a combination of the two traditional approaches to translation to machine code: [ahead-of-time compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation "Ahead-of-time compilation") (AOT), and [interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_\(computing\) "Interpreter (computing)"), which combines some advantages and drawbacks of both.
# Ahead-of-time
* (**AOT compilation**) is the act of [compiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") an (often) higher-level [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") into an (often) lower-level language before execution of a program, usually at build-time, to reduce the amount of work needed to be performed at [run time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_\(program_lifecycle_phase\) "Run time (program lifecycle phase)").
* It is most commonly associated with the act of [compiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") a higher-level [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") such as [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_\(programming_language\) "C (programming language)") or [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++"), or an [intermediate representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation "Intermediate representation") such as [Java bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode "Java bytecode") or [Common Intermediate Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language "Common Intermediate Language") (CIL) code, into native [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code "Machine code") so that the resulting binary file can execute natively, just like a standard native compiler. When being used in this context, it is often seen as an opposite of [just-in-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation "Just-in-time compilation") (JIT) compiling.
