* when two or more pointers or references refer to the same memory location
* In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), **aliasing** describes a situation in which a data location in [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_\(computers\) "Memory (computers)") can be accessed through different symbolic names in the program. Thus, modifying the data through one name implicitly modifies the values associated with all aliased names, which may not be expected by the programmer.
* As a result, aliasing makes it particularly difficult to understand, analyze and optimize programs.
