### internal-combustion engine
An internal-combustion engine goes through four strokes: intake, compression, combustion (power), and exhaust. As the piston moves during each stroke, it turns the crankshaft.

* internal-combustion engines are divided into two groups: continuous-combustion engines and intermittent-combustion engines. 
* **The continuous-combustion engine** is characterized by a steady flow of fuel and oxidizer into the engine. A stable flame is maintained within the engine (e.g., [jet engine](https://www.britannica.com/technology/jet-engine)). 
* **The intermittent-combustion engine** is characterized by periodic ignition of [air](https://www.britannica.com/science/air) and fuel and is commonly referred to as a [reciprocating](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reciprocating) engine. Discrete volumes of air and fuel are processed in a cyclic manner.
* [Gasoline](https://www.britannica.com/technology/gasoline-fuel) [piston](https://www.britannica.com/technology/piston-and-cylinder) engines and [diesel engines](https://www.britannica.com/technology/diesel-engine) are examples of this second group.
