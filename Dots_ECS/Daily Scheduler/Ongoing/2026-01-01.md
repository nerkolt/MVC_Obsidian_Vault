* Inputs infrastructure  
* integrate inputs manager & unity input system
to switch between 2 systems using that infrastructure
* `PlayerInputProvider.cs` uses inputsManager (tool created by yassine)
![[ToolINputMan.png]]
* Basically uses api Unity Input System legacy (old)

* rn MVC code works with `PlayerInputProviderAuthoring.cs`
* the new infrastucture allows to switch between input systems dynamically (2 diff setups)
* we'll make a layer between MVC and inputProviders
