## **Rear-Wheel Drive**

The engine sends power to the rear wheels, which pushes the car forward. This setup offers several benefits for those who prioritize driving dynamics.
* **Better Handling and Balance**
* **Improved Acceleration**
* **Durability**

For transferring the power generated to rear wheels, these vehicles use a number of components such as a drive shaft and a [differential](https://carbiketech.com/differential-mechanism/). The drive shaft is also known as a propeller shaft. Thus, power flows from the power-pack (i.e. [engine](https://carbiketech.com/engine-design-classification/) and [gearbox](https://carbiketech.com/gear-box-transmission-gearbox/)) to the propeller shaft and then to the differential and rear wheels.

## **Front-Wheel Drive**

where the engine powers the front wheels. This configuration offers distinct advantages, particularly in everyday driving conditions and for those prioritizing efficiency and practicality.
* **Better Traction in Poor Conditions**
* **More Efficient Use of Space**
* **Less Balanced Weight Distribution**
* **Limited Performance Potential**

# What Is A Differential Mechanism?

* In order to avoid skidding and slippage when cornering, the driven wheels must follow a different path. Both the wheels must follow this path equally. 
* So, the outer and inner wheels must rotate at different speeds because they do not travel the same distance. Otherwise, the tires will scrub the road. They will force the vehicle to move straight if the wheels are interconnected. 
* You can reduce these effects if you proportionately distribute the engine torque to both the wheels. The manufacturers achieve this by employing the **differential mechanism** in the vehicle.

# Open differential (OD)

![[OD.png|350]]
power takes the path of least resistance so if you spin one tire then that tire will start instantly spinning really fast and the other won't have any power going through it 
![[OD wheels.png| 350]]
## Different scenarios : rotating at diff rpms
* Straight forward
spider wheel doesn't rotate on its own axis and follows the rest
![[wheelRotwithAXels.png]]
* Right turn
![[RightRotationForWheels.png|350]]
spider wheel rotates on its own axis 
spider wheel is having a combined rotation and affects the side gear

![[spiderGearNotRotOnItsOwnAxis.png|350]]
the side gear and spider wheel have to have same peripheral velocity 
![[wSpin+Rot.png|350]]
peripheral velocity at the left side is Vrot+Vspin
peripheral velocity at the right side is Vrot-Vspin
![[velocityRotSpin.png|350]]
Speed on the left is higher than on the right and that's how the rotation happens on diff speeds 
![[Pasted image 20251230171135.png|350]]
* Left Turn
the opposite happens 
![[LeftTurnWheels.png|350]]
in order to carry the load another spider gear is normally added
![[2SpiderGears.png|350]]

## Speed reduction
Torque multiplication
![[closeupSpiderGear.png|350]]
## Turn the power flow direction by 90°

![[PDDiff-wheels.png|350]]

### issue could be encountered
if one of the wheels is on a slippery track (not good traction) then majority of power will be transferred to that wheel which causes vehicle to not move.
![[powerDistributionTransmitterToDiff.png|350]]
# Limited Slip Differential  (LSD)
whenever you spin one wheel the other at the same time will start spinning in the same speed
=> better drift and traction because both tires are spinning trying to grab pavement
![[axel+pinion+ringGear.png|350]]
![[differentialCloseup.png|350]]
since one wheel is on a high traction surface => high torque

# Clutch
Disconnect the flow of power to the transmission without turing off the engine

- **Function:** Prevents wheel lock-up during heavy braking.
- **When it works:** Only during braking.
- **Benefit:** Allows the driver to steer while braking, preventing a skid and maintaining directional control.

- **Function:** Detects and reduces loss of traction to prevent skidding (understeer/oversteer).
- **When it works:** Continuously active, intervening in acceleration, braking, and cornering.
- **Benefit:** Stabilizes the vehicle by braking individual wheels and/or reducing engine power to correct the car's path.
# Axel
![[axle_wheel.png]]

# throttle 
The throttle is a round metal "butterfly" blade that resides inside the round "bore" of the throttle body and controls the amount of air that is allowed to enter a gasoline engine. The opening/closing of this blade is controlled by a cable attached to the throttle pedal or by a computer-controlled electronic throttle motor.
